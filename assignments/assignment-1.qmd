# Assignment 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

My first assignment has four parts.

## (a) Choose a video from one of the following sources and provide a brief summary
in your Quarto document:
- RStudio Global 2022 conference talks
- Posit YouTube channel playlist
- Any R-related video from the web or YouTube that you find interesting

THE VIDEO I SELECTED AND ITS LINK ARE MENTIONED BELOW 
ZJ | Easy larger-than-RAM data manipulation with {disk.frame} | RStudio
https://youtu.be/EOjObl_GSi4?list=PL9HYL-VRX0oTOK4cpbCbRk15K2roEgzVW

SUMMARY:The main topic in the video is easy big data manipulation with "disc.frame". The reason we need this operation is that when we are dealing with large data and R tries to load the data, the data is transferred to RAM. If the data size is larger than RAM can store, we get the error "Cannot allocate vectors of size". Basically, to solve this problem, we break the whole data set into smaller chunks without loading it into memory. ''Disk.frame'' is a folder containing many ''fst'' files. We convert the data to disc.frame by specifying the path to the CSV file with the function ''csv_to_disk.frame(path_to_cvs_file1, path_to_cvs_file2,..)''. We use dplyr verbs to process the data directly. With the srckeep function we specify which columns are loaded into memory, and with the filter, mutate, group, summarise and collect commands we have the possibility to collect the data we want from large data files. 

## (b)
